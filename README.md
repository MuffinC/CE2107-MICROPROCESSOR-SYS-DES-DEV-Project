# CE2107-MICROPROCESSOR-SYS-DES-DEV-Project

Robotic System Learning Kit (RSLK) consist of a MSP432
Launchpad. MSP432, an ARM Cortex M4F processor, act as a main controller to a robotic
system consisting of DC motors and various sensors such as IR Sensor for measuring
distance to an obstacle, reflectance sensor to detect the presence of a colour line below the
robot, bump sensor to detect collision with obstacles and a tachometer to measure the
rotation speed of the motor. On top of that, there are also switches and LEDs to provide
means communication between user and the RSLK. Through this setup, various
microcontroller hardware/software concepts can be taught, these include GPIO handling,
exception handling, pulse width modulation (PWM), timer compare and capture operations,
analog-to-digital converter (ADC), asynchronous serial communication and finite-state
machine design.

This is a compilation of the lab experiment which requires code composer studios
Labs 1-4 is theory and testing out certain functions of the robot
lab 5 will have a lab assesetment where predefined code can be prepared and it is also good to know how the code works as the profs will ask questions regarding it

This folder also includes my lab reports which i believe is accurate at the time of submission
